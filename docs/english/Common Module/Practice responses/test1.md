# Text 1: Essay Extract

## Questions

1. Describe the speaker's emotions in the extract

The Speaker 

2. Explain the difference in perspectives between the speaker and C

Eileen states that she felt underprepared for this climb, stating that C hadn't "prepared me better for what to expect." C instead shrugged and said "we would go UP the beinn." This shows us the conflicting negative perspective Eileen held compared to C, who had felt preparation was unnecessary. While Eileen had claimed she was "not a mountain climber", C said it was "only a hill", showing the difference in their perception of the experience.

3. Discuss how the speaker's struggles has ignited new ideas

Eileen's struggles in climbing the mountain and her differing views with C helped her reflect on the vast differences of perspectives within the human nature. When Eileen reflects that "Scale is paramount when we think of place", she uses a metaphor to communicate how the way you perceive challenges is dependant on your experiences growing up. For someone like her who has never travelled large distances on foot, the mountain climb is extremely difficult. But to C, someone who has grown up traveeling mountains, the mountain that is difficult to Eileen, is very easy to him. Eileen also says "We are reminded of the limitations of our animal bodies" where she understands how she is limited by her growth of evolution
