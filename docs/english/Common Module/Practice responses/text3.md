# Text 3: Poem


## Question 1:

Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan’s “This Is Not a Humanising Poem” directly challenges assumptions about how Muslim people should present themselves to be accepted. The poem confronts the expectation that Muslims must prove their humanity through relatability, respectability, or conformity to Western norms. From the beginning, the poet uses the image of “sirens force their way through window panes” to suggest how news and public narratives invade her personal space, forcing her to respond to stereotypes. By mocking the demand to “write a humanising poem,” she exposes the problematic idea that her life must be made “relatable” to be seen as valuable. Instead of complying, Manzoor-Khan refuses to write the poem others expect from her, rejecting the assumption that Muslim identity needs to be explained, softened, or made palatable. Her defiance—“I will not let this poem force me to write it” is in itself a rebelatory act, one that challenges the power structures that dictate who is considered human and under what conditions. Through this refusal, the poet undermines the audience’s expectations and demands that empathy should not depend on similarity or respectability.


## Question 2:

Manzoor-Khan’s language powerfully conveys the tension between her individual identity and the collective perceptions imposed on her community. She moves between first person and collective pronouns such as “I” and “us” to show how the individual Muslim voice is often merged with or overshadowed by group stereotypes. Her personal refusal when she says “I put my pen down” gradually becomes a communal demand for unconditional acceptance. This is evident when she says “Love us when we’re lazy… Love us when we’re poor.” The poet uses a shift in voice to highlight how personal expression becomes political when society insists on reading individuals as representatives of an entire group. The repetition of imperatives like “Be relatable,” “Be domestic,” and “Be successful” mimics societal pressure and reinforces how external expectations shape self-expression. Her frequent use of negation “I can’t write it / I can’t write / I won’t write it” emphasises resistance, but also exhaustion, suggesting that even defiance is shaped by the gaze of others. Finally, her rhetorical questions, “Am I radical?” and “I wonder if when you buy bombs…” expose double standards in how violence, morality, and humanity are judged depending on who is acting. Through irony, repetition, and contrast, the poet reveals how she is caught between her self-understanding and the collective assumptions that continually try to define her.
