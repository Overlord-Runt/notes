# Text 4: Cartoon

## Describe in what ways the text conveys the human experience of innocence

The political comic conveys the human experience of innocence through the use of blame to show how children are seeing war as a normal experience. When the child says "Too few role models", it signifies how children understand what happens in the world around them and consider it as normal. At the end of the text, the child and his pet end up "killing" each other in a mock war, in response to which the child says "Kind of a stupid game, isnt it?" which tells the reader that children that retain innocence against the political world, have more humanity than those who experience it.
