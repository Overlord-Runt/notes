## What is the common module about?

**__Individual Human Experience__** - An individual human experience is one experienced by one individual

**__Collective Human Experience__** - By extention, collective human experiences are any experiences that we go through together in a group unit

## Exploring Human Experiences

1. What does it mean to be human? List all the qualities of being human that you can think of.

Being human comes down to many things and can be split into 2 different definitions: one biological and one ethical.

A biological human is someone born from 2 humans and has DNA matching that of humans.

The ethical definition of human is quite different however and is actually very ironic to the human nature. The ethical definition of human is someone or something that is kind, loving, and shows respect towards others. An ethical human follows social standards and loves to live in a community. This contrasts against the norm of human nature. The normal human nature is one where people war against each other for the smallest things. It loves destruction and suffering and thinks only for themselves. 

2. What experiences do humans have in their lives?

Humans experience many things in their lives such as love and hate. These experiences change the nature of those who experience it and shape the person they grow to be. Many people are easily infuenced as kids and for that reason they are often seen to mimic morals and actions of their parents as they spend all their time and are influenced by their parents views. As the child grows and goes to school, they gain real world experiences and have viewpoints that can differ to their parents. These can be viewpoints about politics, racism, quality of life or just general mindset issues.

3. Are there texts you have seen or read which show a human experience strongly?

Pokemon Adventures: Emerald follows a boy named Emerald who does not believe in being friends with pokemon. His viewpoints see pokemon as tools for battle. He always changes his pokemon to fit a strategy that beats his opponent. But as the story progresses, Emerald is forced to use the same pokemon multiple times and because of this he starts to realise that pokemon are more than just tools for battle, that they wish to be friends and their friendship can help them be stronger.
