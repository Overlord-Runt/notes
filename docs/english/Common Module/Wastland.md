# Waste Land dir. Lucy Walker

## Plot Synopsis

Filmed over nearly 3 years, Waste Land follows renowned artist Vik Muniz as he journeys from his home base in Brooklyn to his natve Brazil and the world's largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. There  he photographs an eclectic band of "catadores" --- or pickers of recycleable materials. Muniz's intial objective was to "paint" the catadores with garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both **dignity** and **despair** as the catadores begin to re-imagine their lives.
