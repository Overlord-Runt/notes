# Anecdote

Assumptions exist everywhere, one look at you and people think they know everything about you. It's a part of everyday society and happens instinctively in everyone. Assumptions aren't just about racism but can stem from personal ties, appearance, and language use. It leads to people being unjustly excluded for things that are completely unrelated to their actual personality. Growing up in Blacktown, its vital to catagorise and assume things about people to avoid getting robbed or beat up. As I experienced more people and learnt more about the people in blacktown, I watched many of them follow the assumptions placed on them however many didnt. One specific person was once assumed by me to be your average eshay dropout. However as I learnt more about him, he wasn't anything like that; He is someone who wants to work hard and do good in school, the only problem being that he was surrounded by the wrong crowd that makes it harder for him to do so. Watching him break my understanding of assumptions made me realise that instead of protecting myself, I was pushing good people away from me by assuming they were bad people.

"You must stick to your conviction but be ready to abandon your assumptions." This is a quote from Waste Land by Lucy Walker and it captures my new viewpoint perfectly. Instead of sticking by your assumptions to achieve your goals, you should be ready to drop them at the slightest bit of contradicting information. In Waste Land, Walker focuses on people who are in a highly disadantaged area and at the beginning assumes that all the people there are poor and uneducated. However when she actually went there, she saw how people were infact poor, however they were not as uneducated as she had assumed. The people there were highly intelligent and had adapted to live in their harsh environment. Walker tells us that assumptions are okay to make, and they help you understand people without specifically meeting them, however they shouldn't be used as a final judgement against a persons identity.
