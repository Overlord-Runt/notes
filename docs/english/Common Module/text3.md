# Touchscreen by Marshall Soulful Jones

1. How does jones establish a critical attitude towards the role of social media in our lives?

Jones criticises how technology has such an intertwined role in the lives of people. Jones uses robotic language and movements during his speech to present himself as a human who in the future turned himself into a robot as a way to exagarate the use of technology in people lives.

2. What has happened to the natural world, according to the song?

The natural world has gone through lots of change where technology is coming into our lives and replacing the actions we would take to socialise with other people and nature.

3. Identity one of each of the following techniques, provide an exampleand explain the effect: Pun, Rhetorical Question, Repetition

Pun: Jones uses fruits like Apples and Blackberries and says that instead of picking out these fruits, we are picking out the brands.

Rhetorical Question: 

Repetition: Jones repeats the sound "click" over and over to signify the sheer volume of use that technology has in our lives by emphasising every time a person would use technology.

4. What does jones mean when he sayd, "Apple picking has always come at great cost"?

In this line, Jones uses a pun to correlate the cost of the time you take to pick apples as in the fruit, to the monetary cost of buying an apple phone in the modern world.

We are never able to properly communicate our emotions and we cannot experience the emotions of others unless it is told to us

6. Identify a paradox in the poem and comment in what makes it effective.
