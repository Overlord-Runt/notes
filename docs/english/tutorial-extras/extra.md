format dropdowns like this in a file named `_category_.json`: 
```
{
  "label": "Dropdown Name",
  "position": 3,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index"
  }
}
```

You can put an img folder in these folders and use that for asset management

put that on top of every md file but with the order you want it to be in
