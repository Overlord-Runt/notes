# International Financial Flows

International Financial flows are driven by Speculators and currency traders for purposes of:

- Short term gains from price movements
- Hedging against future movements in asset prices or exchange rates
    - Hedging means reducing the amount of risk(buy or sell something else to offset the speculative loss)


## Reasons for expansion in international financial flows:

1. Lower controls on foreign currency markets, flows of foreign capital, banking interest rates and international investments in equity and debt markets
2. Technological change: higher integration of international finiancial markets, more trading platforms, lower fees for buying/selling assets internationally
