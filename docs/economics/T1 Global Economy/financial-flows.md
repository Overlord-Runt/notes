# International Financial Flows

International Financial flows are driven by Speculators and currency traders for purposes of:

- Short term gains from price movements
- Hedging against future movements in asset prices or exchange rates
    - Hedging means reducing the amount of risk(buy or sell something else to offset the speculative loss)


## Reasons for expansion in international financial flows:

1. Lower controls on foreign currency markets, flows of foreign capital, banking interest rates and international investments in equity and debt markets
2. Technological change: higher integration of international finiancial markets, more trading platforms, lower fees for buying/selling assets internationally

Foreign portfolio investment is wjere equity and debt securities are aquired.

TNCs are companies that operate in 2 or more countries

## Review Questions

9. Discuss the impact of the Global Financial Crisis on global financial flows in 2008-09. What are the main types of financial instruments traded in global capital markets?

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008–09 had a large impact on global financial flows, triggering a sharp contraction in cross-border capital movements. The collapse of major financial institutions, particularly in the United States and Europe, led to a loss of confidence in the global banking system. Interbank lending froze, credit markets dried up, and investors pulled back from riskier assets, resulting in a flight to safety. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flows declined significantly as multinational corporations and institutional investors reassessed their exposure to volatile markets. Emerging economies, which had previously benefited from robust capital inflows, experienced sudden reversals, currency depreciation, and economic slowdowns. The crisis underscored the interconnectedness of global financial systems and prompted regulatory reforms aimed at improving transparency and resilience.

Global capital markets trade a wide range of financial instruments. These include equity instruments such as common and preferred shares, debt instruments like government and corporate bonds, and derivative products such as options, futures, and swaps. Foreign exchange instruments—including spot contracts, forwards, and currency swaps—are also widely traded. Additionally, hybrid instruments like convertible bonds and structured products combine features of debt and equity, offering investors tailored risk-return profiles.
