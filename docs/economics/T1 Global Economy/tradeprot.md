# Trade Protection

## What is Trade Protection?

Trade Protection (or protectionism) refers to government policies tha restrict international trade to help domestic industries compete against foreign imports.

These policies are designed to protect local businesses and jobs from overseas competition

## Reasons for Protection

- Protection of infant industries
- Protection of employment during a recession
- Protection against the dumping of imports below factor cost
- Reducing a balance of payments deficit

## Types of protection

Tariffs - taxes on imported goods to make them more expensive

Quotas - Limits on the number or value of goods that can be imported

Subsidies - Financial support to local producers to help them compete

Import bans or regulations - Legal restrictions that block or slow certain imports


## Quotas

### Economic Effect of a Quota

- Domestic producers supply a greater quantity of the good therefore the quota stimulates domestic production and employment
- More domestic resources are attracted to the protected industry therefore a reallocation of reasources towards less efficiesnt producers
- Consumers pay a high price and recieve fewer goods therefore redistributes income away from consumers to domestic producers
- Governments can sometimes raise a small amount of revenue from quotas
- Retaliation effect can occur: In response to tariffs on imports other countries may impose tariffs on the goods that are exported to them

## Economic effects of a Subsity

- Domestic producers supply a greater quantity of the good therefore the quota stimulates domestic production and employment
- More domestic resources are attracted to the protected industry therefore a reallocation of resources towards less efficient producers
- Consumers pay a LOWER price and recieve MORE goods. However consumers still pay indirectly for subsities through higher taxes
- Subsities impose direct costs on government budgets

## Export Incentives

- Assistance such as grants, loans, or technical advice to local businesses to increase markeet share overseas
- Tax cncessions, tax incentives and export assistance to domestic firms

EXAMPLE: Australia's Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) program reimburses companies up to 5% of their export promotion costs, and provides general assistance to local manufacturers, provides grants to encourage small to medium enterprises market and pomote globally.

- Do not directly protect local businessese against foreign producers
- More about improving local business' international competitiveness and global market share

### Difference between subsities and local content rules

- subsities: paying local firms to lower prices
- local content rules: requiring products to be made with a certain % of local goods
