## Domestic Factors

### Natural resources

- Economies that have an abundant and reliable supply of cheap natural resources have better opportunities. for economic development

### Labout supply and quality

- Highly educated and skilled labour can allow for a more productive labour force

### Access to Capital and Indebtness

- Low income levels provide little opportunity for savings that can be used for investment

- Poorly developed financial systems makes it difficult for businesses to gain easy access to loans

- Interest payments on past loans also reduce income available for government spending on education and healthcare

### Entrepreneurial Culture

- Political Instability, corruption and a lack of law enforcement can undermine the confidence of investors, who will be reluctant to take risks if their business interests are threatened by an inadequate structure for resolving legal disputes, corruption, etc


### Economic policies

- If an economy is purely driven by market forces, it may acheive a high level of economic growth, but it may not improve education, health care and quality of life

- Excessive government control over economic decision-making can constrain entrepreneurship and innovation, reducing economic growth

- Policies relating to trade, financial flows, investment flows, TNCs and the country's participation in regional and global economic organisations will influence the economies ability to take advantage of the benefits of integration


## Global Factors

### Global Trade System

- Development of trading blocs excludes non-members

- Wealthy countries tend to protect their agricultural sector as they are not competitive against developing nations

### Global Financial Flows

- Financial flows favour countries with higher returns

### Foreign aid

- Aid may be based on strategies or military considerations rather than the needs of the countries
