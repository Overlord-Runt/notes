# The international and regional business cycles

## International Business cycle

This refers to the fluctutions in the economic activity levels (or output levels) in the global economy

1. An expansion - characterised by an upturn in demand
2. The peak - characterised by supply constraints, where inflation starts to rise
3. The downswing - falling demand
4. The trough or recession - global output and demand reach their minimum point (such as the global financial crisis in 2009)

Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US are vital countries in the global economy.

If any of these countries go into recession, many other countries become affected aas well.

## Factors affecting international business cycle

Factors can either strengthen or weaken international business cycles

- Strengthening means more economic integration
    - Resulting in stronger economic growth among countries
- Weakening means less or limiting economic integration
    - Resulting in slower economic growth among countries or in certain regions

## Regional business cycle

This refers to the fluctuations in the economic activity levels in a geographical region

- The business cycle in a region is often heavily influenced byt the largest and most globalised economies within that region
- Particular economic events in one or a few samll countries within a region can also impact the regional business cycle
