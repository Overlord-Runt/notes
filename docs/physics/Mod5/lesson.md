# Projectile motion

## Rectilinear equations

v = u + at

v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup>+2as

Resolve into horizontal and vertical components

Vertical acceleration is constant at g = 9.8

Horizontal and vertical acceleration do not affect each other.

Time is the only thing common between the 2 components

Start solving Y for time and then solve for X
