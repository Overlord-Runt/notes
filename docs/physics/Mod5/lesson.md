# Projectile motion

## Rectilinear equations

v = u + at

v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup>+2as

s = ut + at<sup>2</sup>/2

Resolve into horizontal and vertical components

Vertical acceleration is constant at g = 9.8

Horizontal and vertical acceleration do not affect each other.

Time is the only thing common between the 2 components

Start solving Y for time and then solve for X


## Terms and notes

- A projectile is any object launched into the air and continus to travel without any added input
- The parabola shaped path it amkes is called the __trajectory__
- For simplicity we assume air resistence is neglible
- In order for it to move in a parabola there must be horizontal and vertical movement

3 main points are the turning point, and the start and end points.

Projectiles can be launched at any angle

At the turning point, the trajectory has reached the maximum height. 

If the launch height is not 0, launch height must be added to maximum height calculation to find the height

## Models

Models are used to explain, analyse and predict outcomes
