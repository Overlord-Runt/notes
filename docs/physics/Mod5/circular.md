# Circular motion

deltaV/s = V/r

deltaV/Vt = V/r

deltaV/t = V<sup>2</sup>/r

a = V2/r

f = mv<sup>2</sup>/r

## Velocity in circular motion

Although the object travelling around the circle is moving at a constant speed, its direction is changing so its velocity is changing

The velocity at any point of the circle is the speed in the direction along the tangent to the circle at that point.

V = Circumference/time

Time is the time to complate one revolution

## Centripetal Acceleration

## Angular Position and Velocity

In these calculations you must use radians as the unit for angles and not degrees.

Angular displacement can be written as arclength/radian
