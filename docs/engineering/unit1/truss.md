 # Truss Analysis 

## Types of Supports

Pin or Hinge

![hinge or pin img](#)

They are represented as a dot at the connection and supports against vertical and horizontal forces

---

Roller is represented as a normal hinge but with multiple open circles underneath

![roller img](#)

Rollers can support against forces perpendicular to the surface

---

Fixed is represented as something half into the ground.

![fixed img](#)

It can support against vertial and horizontal forces plus moments

## Free body diagrams

1. Draw diagram as needed
2. Determine the reactions at supports
3. Take moment about the non-roller support to find the reaction at non-roller support
4. Use sum of F<sub>v</sub> = 0 or sum of F,<sub>h</sub> = 0 to find the other non-roller reactions.
